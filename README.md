### About

TuiCss is a library focused to create web applications using an interface based in ASCII table, like MS-DOS applications. This kind of interface is very eligible because the ultra-contrast colors used and the less effects of the elements. The main framework thats is following to develop TuiCss is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision">Turbo Vision Framework</a> with some techniques with [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character), but some others frameworks were checked too, like [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)), [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses), [Newt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_(programming_library)), etc. Check the examples page in the wiki to see some creations!
